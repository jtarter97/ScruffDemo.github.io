        <h1> What is the heart and soul of scruff </h1>
        <p>"There are many stories of urban vigilantes born out of witnessing or experiencing violence. What makes Scruff different is the parallel story of how Adam Davis deals with this very personal trauma. The story is partly told through conversations with his therapist as Adam tries to deal with his mental anguish through counseling.
