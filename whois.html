        <h1> Who is scruff </h1>
        <p>"The Unforgiving Scruff is the story about Adam Davis, a university professor in his early 30’s,
             whose ideals for his students are shattered by an act of horrific violence right outside the school’s campus. 
            The trauma experienced by this event leads the professor down a dark twisted path for justice
            , turning him into the urban vigilante, known as The Scruff."
